# Chinese remainder theorem 
I am writing this memo to inform you about a program we will be developing that demonstrates the working of a multi-layer crypto algorithm based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). This program will have a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user interaction and understanding.

### Objective:
The objective of this program is to provide a visual demonstration of how a multi-layer crypto algorithm based on CRT works. By using a GUI, we aim to make the learning experience more intuitive and accessible to users who may not have a strong background in cryptography.

### Key Features:

GUI Interface: The program will have an interactive GUI to allow users to input values and visualize the algorithm's steps in real-time.
Input Options: Users will be able to input the required parameters, such as modulus values, ciphertext, and private/public keys.
Encryption: The program will showcase the encryption process, demonstrating how the original message is transformed into ciphertext using multiple layers of encryption based on CRT.
Decryption: Users will be able to observe the decryption process, where the ciphertext is decrypted layer by layer to retrieve the original message.
Step-by-Step Visualization: The GUI will display each step of the algorithm, highlighting the calculations and intermediate values involved.
Error Handling: The program will include error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and prevent any unexpected behavior.
